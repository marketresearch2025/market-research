Aptamers are short, single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that can bind to specific target molecules, such as proteins or small molecules, with high affinity and specificity. They have various applications in various fields, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and research. They possess the remarkable ability to bind with exceptional affinity and specificity to a specific target, often likened to "artificial antibodies." The selection process for aptamers involves an iterative in vitro method that alternates binding and amplification steps, to identify aptamers, from a large oligonucleotide library, encompassing distinct sequences. During this process, the target is mixed with the library, and a partitioning step is executed to separate target-bound sequences from those that remain free. Various techniques, including filtration, chromatography, and centrifugation, are employed for this partitioning. The sequences bound to the target are subsequently PCR-amplified, and the resulting pool is once again mixed with the target, this time with increased selection pressure. This repetitive procedure is conducted multiple times, leading to the survival of the most potent binders from among millions of sequences. Aptamers are then identified through sequencing.

<strong>Aptamers in Biotechnology and Medicine: A Driving Force for Advancements </strong>

The growth of the aptamers market can be attributed to several key factors. They are extensively employed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research, fueling advancements in drug discovery and development, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions. Diagnostic and pathology laboratories favor the utilization of aptamer-based diagnostic products for disease diagnosis at the cellular level. This preference is driven by the compact size, remarkable specificity, selectivity, and effectiveness of aptamers. As a result, the growing incidence of diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disorders (CVD), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is likely to lead to a higher number of patients seeking diagnostic services in these labs. This, in turn, contributes to an increased demand for aptamer-based diagnostic products. For instance
<ul>
 	<li>In June 2023, Aptamer Group and Neuro-Bio joined forces to collaborate on the development of a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease. They announced the successful creation of Optimer binders that specifically target a novel Alzheimer's disease biomarker. These binders are poised to facilitate the creation of a lateral flow test for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul>
Aptamers also possess the capability to be conjugated to drugs, functioning as drug delivery systems. They have been conjugated with chemotherapy medications to specifically target and bind to cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Additionally, their advantages such as reduced potential for undesired immune responses, high thermal stability, and cost-effectiveness, are anticipated to drive increased demand for aptamers. Aptamers are typically produced through a method known as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), which can be time-consuming and involve iterative steps. To address this limitation, Vivonics Inc., a medical device company, has devised and patented a streamlined one-step technique called Rapid Isolation of DNA Aptamers (RIDA) for isolating high-affinity and highly selective aptamers. These developments are poised to promote the adoption of aptamers.

<strong>Diverse Applications &amp; Advantages of Aptamers Over Antibodies Drives its Demand</strong>

The aptamer market is experiencing significant growth driven by the increasing recognition of aptamers' advantages over antibodies. While antibodies have their limitations when it comes to targeting small molecules, aptamers excel in this regard. Aptamers, short DNA or RNA molecules, offer high specificity and affinity for a broad range of target molecules, including proteins, small compounds, and cells. Aptamers demonstrate superior performance in binding to small molecules and dyes, making them easily adaptable for use in traditional diagnostic kits, and expanding their applicability to point-of-care diagnostics. This expansion is poised to boost their market value and foster greater acceptance of aptamers for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Aptamers also can bind to larger molecules, particularly proteins that constitute approximately 98% of all molecules. This feature simplifies the discovery of biomarkers and the development of diagnostic kits.

Unlike antibodies, typically produced by eliciting an immune response in animal models or through recombinant DNA technology, aptamers can be synthesized using cost-effective chemical methods. Consequently, aptamers present an appealing choice for the creation of novel therapeutic drugs and diagnostic kits. Additionally, antibodies face challenges in treating neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's due to the blood-brain barrier. Although technological advancements have partially addressed this issue, the effectiveness of antibodies in treating such disorders remains limited. In contrast, aptamers, being short oligonucleotides, can permeate the blood-brain barrier, offering promise for neurodegenerative disorder treatment. For instance,
<ul>
 	<li>In July 2023, Zentek and McMaster revealed encouraging outcomes for their aptamer-based technology, which is exclusively licensed from McMaster University. Their aptamer platform has shown successful results as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2 in pre-clinical animal trials. Dr. Yingfu Li's aptamers, developed through repeated testing, exhibited comparable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 when compared to a commercial monoclonal antibody, indicating their potential in combating the virus</li>
</ul>
Furthermore, antibodies can trigger an immune response in the host, potentially leading to severe side effects whereas aptamers are non-immunogenic and safer. They offer various advantages such as ease of design and synthesis, high efficiency, rendering them a relatively cost-effective option. Additionally, aptamers exhibit reduced immunogenicity and allow for rapid development. The growing awareness of these benefits has spurred research and development efforts, leading to expanded applications in various fields and a promising future for aptamers in the market.
