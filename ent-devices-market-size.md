ENT Devices are used in the identification, therapy, or surgical treatment of any ear, nose and throat disorders. These devices  help in correcting problems related to hearing, smell, snoring, or speaking. Some of the ENT devices available in the market are endoscopes, hearing aids, hearing screening instruments, hearing implants, ear tubes, voice prosthesis devices, surgical devices, powered surgical tools, image-guided surgery systems, balloon dilation devices which are used in sinus, CO2 lasers, among others.

<strong>Promising Prospects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the ENT Market  </strong>

The advent of AI is set to revolutionize the evolution of image-guided ENT and skull base procedures and favorably impact the diagnosis of laryngeal cancers. Citing the lucrative prospects of AI in the ENT market, players are incessantly striving to launch innovative products in the market.

For instance:
<ul>
 	<li>In September 2021, Acclarent launched its first-ever AI-powered ENT technology in the U.S., designed to simplify surgical planning and provide real-time feedback during ENT navigation procedures</li>
 	<li>Similarly, AI is poised to make giant strides in the field of Otolaryngology. The Netherlands based company WSK Medical is optimistic that by the end of the year 2023, European otolaryngologists may be using artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose laryngeal cancer. The company has developed a platform - Zeno AI - that gives ENT-surgeons a real-time AI analysis of early laryngeal cancer detection that can be utilised during an endoscopic examination (laryngoscopy). Zeno AI considerably reduces time to analyse complex medical data and assists in diagnosing laryngeal cancer faster. The product is not commercialized yet but it is already in use in two European academic medical centers and in proving helpful in identifying laryngeal lesions</li>
</ul>
<strong>Technological Advancements in ENT Devices Fuel the Market</strong>

The ENT devices market has witnessed a number of technological advancements over the years. The technological advancements in ENT devices is expected to spur its demand in the coming years.

For instance:
<ul>
 	<li>In August 2022, Preceptis Medical secured U.S. FDA clearance for expanded indications for use for the Hummingbird® Tympanostomy Tube System (TTS) for office-based pediatric ear tube procedures. The system was previously cleared in children 6-24 months, this new labeling allows in-office procedures in all children six months and older</li>
</ul>
