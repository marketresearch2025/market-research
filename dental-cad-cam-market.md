CAD (computer-aided-design)/CAM (computer-aided-manufacturing) dentistry is a field of dentistry and prosthodontics that is used to design and improve dental restorations. Using CAD/CAM technology, dentists and dental laboratories provide patients with dental prostheses (crowns, crown lays, veneers, inlays, and onlays), fixed dental prostheses (bridges), dental implant-supported restorations, dentures (removable or fixed), and orthodontic appliances.

<strong>Promising Prospects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the </strong><strong>Dental CAD/CAM Market</strong>

The advent of AI-powered CAD/CAM systems has been instrumental in streamlining the process of designing and manufacturing dental restorations. AI-powered CAD/CAM systems use advanced algorithms to analyze a patient’s dental scans and produce accurate digital models of their teeth. The digital models are then used to make customized restorations that fit the patient’s unique anatomy and bite. These systems offer advantages such as precision, comfort, functional restoration, reduced chances of complications, and the need for adjustments or replacements. Citing the lucrative prospects of AI in dental CAD/CAM systems, players are incessantly striving to launch innovative products in the market.
